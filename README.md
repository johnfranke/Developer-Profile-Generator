# Developer Profile Generator

I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. You start the application with the following command: node index.js

The use is asked for a GitHub username and then for a favorite color. Using javascript and npm libraries the application creates a PDF populated with a profile image, username, link to the location, link to the GitHub profile, link to the blog, user's bio, number of public repositories, number of followers and number of users following.
